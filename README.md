# Module-6--Lab-


Hello World,

Alex here, I am going to talk to you about the lab assignment that I had to complete. In this assignment,
I had to create different programs for the different problems that were in the assignment. Each of the different 
programs are able to be used to help with different things. Some of them used the random mode which helps pick a 
random number or a random day. The other ones can be able to figure out something that you have for math. These
programs can help in different ways. 

From Alex
